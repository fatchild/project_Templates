# project_Templates
 A place where I store useful project templates I have created. Usually at the start of creating a new type of project.

# Templates

| Template directory name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| pre_stack_web_application | Just the very basic files for an organized web project. No technologies used just basic .md files. A good starting place when working things out or creating a new project with a new tech stack. |
